## Software Crisis
- Development in the Software Technology continue to be dynamic, complex.
- Most of the software required modification due to the change in user requirements and data formats.
- These studies showed that software products should be evaluated carefully for their quality before they are delivered and implemented. Some of the quality issues that must be considered for critical evaluation are:
  - Correctness
  - Maintainability
  - Reusability
  - Openness and interpolation
  - Portability
  - Security
  - Integrity
  - User friendliness
- This forced softare engineers and industry to look for new approaches to software design and development.

## Software Evolution

**Ernest Tello**, a well-known writer in the field of AI, compared the evolution of softare technology to the growth of a tree. Like a tree, the software evolution has had distinct phases or "layers" of growth. These layers were built up one by one over the last five decades with each layer representing an improvement over the previous one. 
However, the analogy fails if we consider the life of these layers. In software systems, each of the layers continues to be functional, whereas in the case of tree, only the uppermost layer is functionl.

**Alan Kay**, one of the promoters of Object oriented paradigm and the principal designer of Smalltalk, has said : "*Complexity increases, architecture dominates the basic material*". To build today's complex software, it is just not enough to put together a sequence of programming statements and sets of procedures and modules; we need to incorporate sound construction techniques and program structures that are easy to comprehend, implement and modify.
